Deprecated version of AuditorMetrix
=====

Utilizing R, Shiny, NVD3, and Bootstrap:

I wanted to branch off the code for a work project before it got too propietary. I have anonymized the data and although some of the features were broken in the process, it is mostly functional. I plan to package the current and much more sophisticated version of the app and share it with the community early next year. Until I have time to do so I will share the deprecated branch version. The live demo can be found here:

Have fun with Shiny!
